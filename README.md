# UniversityAttendanceTool
University Attendance Tool is a free, mobile-first web app that solves the pain of marking Google Sheet attendance on small phone screens. It provides a large, one-tap interface that integrates directly with Google Drive (Apps Script). Features include automated attendance column creation and strict filtering to display only editable class sheets.
